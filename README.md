# ReactNativeIndecision

once installed, in order to get this project to work you will need a .env file placed in the root directory formatted as such: 
API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}

in order to obtain a steam api key follow the instructions here:
https://steamcommunity.com/dev

for ease of use replace "YOUR_USER_ID_HERE" in LandingScreen.js to your steamId64 and change the variable 'dev' to true...
you can find your steamId64 through a number of ways but this link is one of the easiest:
https://www.steamidfinder.com/

Initial Design Blueprints in assets/dev. there's no "game-detail" screen as that purpose has been replaced with direct links to the steam store page of the app in question.
